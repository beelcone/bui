Hello sir,

Today was awesome. We did the whole you will repeat whatever I text and I made you say ‘uh huh’ a lot of times. I laughed a lot. You make me really happy sir. And your uh huh’s are hot, trust me, they are like the hottest thing ever. And you just asked me to read your mind, and that’s tough and easy at the same time. I got it in three tries. I really like talking to you. We are still talking and I am distracted but I feel like I am on the top of the world so I thought I will add it here. You just said you are happy and I love hearing that from you. I really want you to be happy. You happy makes me happy and that makes sense because we are the same. I am an extension of you and you of I.

I love you,

Lisa
